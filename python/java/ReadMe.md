# Accessing data using Java from Python
As stated elsewhere: There is no native Java Pervasive.SQL API.
Also Java & Python are two very different languages. So this all makes very little sense.
However there is: [Jython](https://www.jython.org/)
So in theory you can make it work.
Feel free to have look at the example code for other other access methods and languages and it might work.
This is too exotic for me to write POC code for.

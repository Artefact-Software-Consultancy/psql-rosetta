# JDBC on Python
Sounds silly, so much to my surprise I found [JayDeBeApi](https://pypi.org/project/JayDeBeApi/)
This promisses a way to achive MKDE access through JDBC from Python.
Obviously not something which is a common approach, supported and tested.
I do not feel the need to write some POC code for this.

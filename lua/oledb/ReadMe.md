# Data access method OLEDB using Lua

OLEDB is a Windows platform specific technology.
Lua on Windows is not very common. Let alone when you add Pervasive.SQL to the mix.
Now on top of that you want to use OLEDB?
Quite likely you are unique. This is not a supported environment. Far from!
However this does not make it impossible by default.

While working for Artefact Software & Consultancy, a Btrieve/Pervasive/Acian/Zen distributer and tech centre in The Netherlands, it always puzzled me why the documentation was so poor regarding examples. On various occasions I started developing demo applications, but never finished them for various reasons. Time being an important one. But also: it is hard to create example code which makes sense on every platform, language etc.
I started out to develop an application in a Python web framework called Flask, but then got distracted by questions other people had regarding how to access their database(engine).
This resulted in this repository of code snippets demonstratiting how to access the datase(engine) using various languages and access methods.
All code is mine and distributed under the MIT License unless otherwise stated.
Some of my work, especially the Btrieve 2/SWIG code, was inspired by Linda and Bill. I adapted their example code a bit.

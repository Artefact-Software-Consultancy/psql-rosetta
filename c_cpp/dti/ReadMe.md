Shock and awe: most recent development environment mentioned originates from 2005...

I have no desire (yet) to test this on current environments (VisualStudio, MingW or GCC).

In 1999 someone asked: is DTI only available for C/C++. 20 years later this is still true for at least Linux.
See: https://communities.actian.com/s/question/0D53300003rhokOCAQ/dti-interface

The good news is that SDKs exist for both Windows and Linux. Example code is included although well beyond 10 years old.

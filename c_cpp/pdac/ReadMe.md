# Data Access using Pervasive Direct Access Compontents (PDAC) from C/C++

PDAC was developed for the Borland (now Embarcadero) environments C++ Builder & Delphi and is obviously unique to Pervasive.SQL and Windows only.

As can read in the [PDAC manual](https://docs.actian.com/psql/psqlv13/#page/pdac%2Fpdac.htm%23) PDAC is a set of Visual Component Library (VCL) components that allow direct access to PSQL database engines from within the Embarcadero Delphi and C++ Builder Environments.

At the moment I do not have access to both so unfortunately no example code is provided.

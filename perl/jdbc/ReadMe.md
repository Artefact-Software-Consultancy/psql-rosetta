# JDBC on Perl
Sounds silly, have not found a bridge implementation.

This promisses a way to achive MKDE access through JDBC from Perl if it would be available.
Obviously not something which is a common approach, supported and tested.
I do not feel the need to write some POC code for this. (would also need implentation of the bridge)

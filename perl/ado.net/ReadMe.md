# Accessing data using Microsoft ADO from Perl

Does not seem a logical approach however some options seem to exist:

* [PerlNet](https://www.activestate.com/?s=perlnet)
* [Win32:OLE](https://metacpan.org/pod/Win32::OLE)

But as COM can be used the conclusion is it can be done. However this is not tested with Pervasive.SQL
One of the reasons I do not feel the need to write POC code for this.

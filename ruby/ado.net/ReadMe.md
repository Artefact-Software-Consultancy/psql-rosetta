# Data Access using ADO.NET from Ruby

Ruby on Windows is not very common. Let alone when you add Pervasive.SQL to the mix.
Now on top of that you want to use ADO .NET?
Quite likely you are unique. This is not a supported environment. Far from!
However this does not make it impossible by default.
Maybe this link will get you in the right direction: [Ruby ADO and MS SQLserver](https://rubyonwindows.blogspot.com/2007/03/ruby-ado-and-sqlserver.html)
Ancient information, but probably better than nothing.

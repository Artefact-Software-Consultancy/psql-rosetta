# Btrieve API 2 access from Ruby
There is no official API supporting this.

In theory one could write a SWIG interface file to support accessing Pervasive.SQL using the Btrieve2 API from Ruby.
This has been done for PHP, Perl and Python. And as Ruby is also supported by SWIG...

See: [SWIG documentation](http://swig.org/doc.html)

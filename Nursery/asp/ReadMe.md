* ASP classic : a scripting language common on mosty Windows webservers (IIS) in the 90s.

# Final note
ASP is dead and buried. Lets keep it that way. Or...
It is still a quick way to get some results when using IIS.
Where as ASP.NET requires some serious work as in boilerplating a Visual Studio project with many files.
This is a bit too much for a quick demonstration of code.

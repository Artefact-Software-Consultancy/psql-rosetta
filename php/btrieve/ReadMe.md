# Data access using the Btrieve API from PHP

Summer 2019 no native Btrieve API access for/from PHP is available from Actian.

Theoretical alternatives:
- Btrieve2 API
- other type of data access such as ODBC (transactional (SQL), not navigational (noSQL))
- Investigate availability of third-party solutions

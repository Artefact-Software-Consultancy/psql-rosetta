# Data access method SQL from PHP

Pervasive.SQL has its own SQL dialect which is not 100% identical to ODBC standards.
You can use it from a SQL client application as for instance can be found in the Pervasive Control Center (PCC) or at the Linux commandline tool ISQL.
However this dialect if not offered as a separate API. Instead the programmers manual redirects you to ODBC.

For this reason no SQL example code can be found here.

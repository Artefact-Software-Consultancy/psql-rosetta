# JDBC on PHP
Sounds awkward, so much to my surprise I found [php-jdbc-bridge](https://github.com/JCotton1123/php-jdbc-bridge)
This promisses a way to achive MKDE access through JDBC from PHP.
Obviously not something which is a common approach, supported and tested.
I do not feel the need to write some POC code for this.

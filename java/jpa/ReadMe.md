# Java Persistence API (JPA)

According to: https://docs.actian.com/psql/psqlv13/index.html#page/welcome%2Flibwelcome.htm
this is an Access Method. However the overview is the only place in the manuals where it gets mentioned.

also see: https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/

Oracle docs: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html

It seems "all this information" is enough as no further reference in Pervasive.SQL documentation can be found.

## Conclusion

I am going to ignore this. So, sorry, no code.

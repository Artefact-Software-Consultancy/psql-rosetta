# Accessing a database from Java

A very good generic read is Marco Behlers [A guid to acessing databases in Java](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/a-guide-to-accessing-databases-in-java).
Specific to Pervasive.SQL comes:
* JDBC
  * [Introducing the PSQL JDBC Driver](https://docs.actian.com/psql/psqlv13/jdbc/jdbc_gd.htm#ww17152)
  * [Programming with the PSQL JDBC 2 Driver](https://docs.actian.com/psql/psqlv13/jdbc/jdbctasks.htm#ww68687)
* Java Class Library (JCL)
  * [Introduction to the PSQL Java Interface](https://docs.actian.com/psql/psqlv13/jcl/javintro.htm#ww16848)
  * [Programming with the Java Class Library](https://docs.actian.com/psql/psqlv13/jcl/java_api.htm#ww23066)
Both access methods have their own subsection in this repository.

# Distributed Tuning Interface (DTI)

documentation: https://docs.actian.com/psql/psqlv13/#page/dti%2Fdtiguide.htm%23

## Example code
Example code is available in the SDK for:

* Windows
** MS Visual C++ 8 (MSVC2005)
** MS Visual C++ 7 (MSVC2003)
** MS Visual C++ 6 (MSVC)
** Delphi 5 (DELPHI5)
* Linux
** GCC : C header files + 4 examples (dbinfo.c dtitest.c license.c mkdeinfo.c)

## View
Shock and awe: most recent development environment mentioned originates from 2005...

I have no desire (yet) to test this on current environments (VisualStudio, MingW or GCC).

In 1999 someone asked: is DTI only available for C/C++. 20 years later this is still true for at least Linux.
See: https://communities.actian.com/s/question/0D53300003rhokOCAQ/dti-interface

Linux code examples are datestamped July/September 2015.

## Alternatives?
An internal DTI API for Java exists. See: https://communities.actian.com/s/question/0D53300003x18CyCAI/javadtijar
